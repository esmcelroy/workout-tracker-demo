## 🧪 Testing

### Unit Tests (Vitest + Testing Library)

Run unit tests headless, in UI mode, or with coverage:

```bash
npm test
npm run test:ui
npm run test:coverage
```

Configs and helpers:
- Vitest config: [vitest.config.ts](vitest.config.ts)
- Test setup (jsdom, mocks): [tests/setup.ts](tests/setup.ts)
- Render helper with providers: [tests/test-utils.tsx](tests/test-utils.tsx)

### End-to-End (Playwright)

Install browsers once, then run tests (ensure the app is running):

```bash
npx playwright install
npm run dev
npm run test:e2e
```

Playwright configuration: [playwright.config.ts](playwright.config.ts)

## 🤝 Contributing

We follow strict Test-Driven Development (TDD):

- Write a failing test first (Vitest for units; Playwright for flows).
- Implement only what's needed to pass; then refactor.
- Include tests with all feature PRs; new functionality requires coverage.
- Mock `fetch` and `localStorage` where relevant (see [tests/setup.ts](tests/setup.ts)).
- Use the shared `render()` helper with providers from [tests/test-utils.tsx](tests/test-utils.tsx).
- Keep tests deterministic and fast; avoid time-based flakiness.
